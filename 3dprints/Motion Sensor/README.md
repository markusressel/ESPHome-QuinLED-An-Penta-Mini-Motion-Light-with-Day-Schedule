# 3D Printable Cases for the C4001 Motion Sensor

I have designed a 3D printable cases for the sensors mentioned above.

There are two versions of the case:

1. a bigger one, which is more suitable if you want to use wires with dupont pin plugs.
2. a "slim" one, which is more suitable if you solder directly to the board and can route the cables through a smaller hole.

The files can also be found on printables.com, see: TODO
